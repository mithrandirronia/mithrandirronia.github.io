				<tr><h3>Synopsis/Genre</h3></tr>
				<tr>Orphan Black is a Canadian science fiction thriller television series created by screenwriter Graeme Manson and director John Fawcett, starring Tatiana Maslany as several identical people who are clones. The series focuses on Sarah Manning, a woman who assumes the identity of one of her fellow clones, Elizabeth Childs, after witnessing Childs' suicide. The series raises issues about the moral and ethical implications of human cloning, and its effect on issues of personal identity</tr><br><br>
				<tr><h3>Main characters</h3></tr>
				<tr>Tatiana Maslany plays the act of all the main clone characters (Sarah Manning, Beth Childs, Katja Obinger, Alison Hendrix, Cosima Niehaus, Helena, Rachel Duncan, Jennifer Fitzsimmons, Tony Sawicki, Krystal Goderitch, Veera "MK" Suominen), all born in 1984 to various women by in vitro fertilisation. Their creation was referred to as Project Leda. The series focuses on Sarah Manning, a small-time con woman and orphan who is the only clone to have a biological daughter. (All clones were presumed to be sterile before Sarah was discovered, with one of the original scientists revealing that the clones, as 'prototypes', were all designed to be sterile, and it is also revealed in season 2 that Helena is also able to conceive given her origin as Sarah's specific twin.) Other clones include Elizabeth "Beth" Childs, a police detective whose suicide at the start of the series leads Sarah into the conspiracy; Alison Hendrix, a soccer mom who tries to be the perfect housewife, but suffers from pill and drink addiction as well as jumping to conclusions; Cosima Niehaus, a lesbian graduate student studying evolutionary developmental ("evo-devo") biology who researches the clones' biology; Helena, the twin sister of Sarah, a fanatic assassin trained by the Proletheans who has suffered severe abuse throughout her life; Rachel Duncan, an executive at the Dyad Institute, who was raised knowing that she is a clone from childhood. Maslany also voiced the scorpion, called Pupok, that speaks to Helena in her hallucinations in Season 3.</tr>
